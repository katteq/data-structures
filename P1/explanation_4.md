To solve the active directory problem I decided to build a cache of users which is a dictionary of users name/id and all the directories list they belong to. The cache is built on the first `is_user_in_group` function execution, used python dictionary to map users to their corresponding sets of the groups. This cache guarantees a constant lookup time on every subsequent function call.
