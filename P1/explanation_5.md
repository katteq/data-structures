In this problem, I have utilized all my knowledge about the blockchain to build the trivial its version using a linked list and python hashing library. Each block hash value is constructed of the several information pieces: data itself, previous block hash and timestamp of the new block. The blockchain class keeps the chain of all the blocks, reference to the last block and the chain size.

I had added two tests to test a blockchain hash function and test verification of the data by recalculation of the hashes when the data of one of the blocks has been tamp
