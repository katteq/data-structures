This solution has been made using the array traversal with the O(n) time complexity. The function loop starts from the beginning of the array checking whether the current element is either `0` or `2`. The point of the algorithm is to place the `0` and `2` in their correct positions. Therefore all elements equal to `1` will automatically appear in their correct positions.
