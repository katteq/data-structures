There are approximately 5 lines of the code in total will be executed looping over the list of the text messages records in the count_phone_numbers function.

Given that the amount of records in total 9072, we could assume that the order of the alorithm is O(5*9072), or O(5*n).

After the approximation, it would be O(n), which means the run-time of the algorithm increases linearly with the input size.
