There are approximately 12 lines of the code in total will be executed looping over the list of the phone calls records using function find_number_with_longest_calls_time.

Given that the amount of records in total 5213, we could assume that the order of the alorithm is O(12*5213), or O(12*n).

After the approximation it would be O(n), which means the run-time of the algorithm increases linearly to the amount of the call records.
